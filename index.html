    <p>This is a small website made by me, Himal Kumal To introduce myself.
        It may not be much but it's because I made This
        as a example of how to make a website everyone can join.
    </p>
    <p>Programming is something very fun yet very easy. I will prove it with this.
    This website you see took no more than 20 minutes. </p>
