            <p>Hey bbg, I am Himal Kumal. If you found this then you are very sigma.</p>
            <p>Please start programming so I will not be the only one suffering from lack of sleep.</p>
            <p>If you wanna be a skibidi sigma like me then you'll have to do a very skibidi thing.
                It doesn't matter what but It has to be skibidi. I could give you a hint.
                Hint: Guitar or Programming. SUFFER WITH ME. JOIN ME. 
            </p>
            <h3>Anyways, This is my presentation of why programming is easy lmao. It only took me like 20 minutes to make this.</h3>
